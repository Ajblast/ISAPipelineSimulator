Registers
	Each core has own register file
ALU
	Each core has ALU

Instructions
	Instructions need to be updated to be 32 bits
		**** Update Encoder
		**** Update Decoder
		
	DSB (Data Synchronization Barrier)
		Will stall the pipeline until the memory and write back stage have completed and are Bubbling
		Ensures that all operations before the barrier are observed before any operation after the barrier
	
	Exclusive Memory
		LDREX - Load Exclusive. Load from a spot in memory and watch the address. Lock is broken if a store occurs at the address from an unexclusive stor or different process wrote to the address
		STREX - Store Exclusive. Store a value into a spot in memory if the lock is still there. Returns success or failure
		CLREX - Clear the exclusive lock on a memory address
		* Only a single memory address can have a lock at a time
		
	Atomics - Will stall the pipeline until the writeback phase has been completed for an instruction
		- Atomic operations are macros!!!!!! We have use for macros
		Store
		Load
		FetchAdd
		FetchSub
		FetchAnd
		FetchOr
		FetchXor
		Exchange
		CompareExchange
		
	How an atomic operation genneraly work
		DSB		- Data Barrier
		LDREX		- Load the value exclusively
		OPERATION	- Perform the operation
		STREX		- Attempt to store it
		CMP 0		- Was the storage successful
		JNE		- Try again if it failed
		DSB		- Data Barrier
		
	Core Instructions
		Yield - Set a bit in the signal register
		WaitForSignal - Waits for a specific mask to be meet
Register
	Core Signal Register
